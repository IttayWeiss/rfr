# ZBRef 

A CLI for zbMATH (https://zbmath.org) for fetching the bibtex data of a publication. 

A common activity when writing articles that reference mathematics papers is to obtain the reference data in bibtex format. A convenient tool for that is zbMATH, providing a GUI for searching for articles. The CLI provides command line access to zbMATH to quickly obtain the bibtex data directly to the clipboard (if you so choose).
