# rfr

A CLI for fetching the bibtex data of a publication. Currently only works with zbMATH (https://zbmath.org).

A common activity when writing articles that reference other papers is to obtain the reference data in bibtex format. This CLI allows searching for articles to quickly obtain their bibtex data, directly to the clipboard (if you so wish). 

A convenient tool for mathematics articles is zbMATH, providing a GUI for searching for articles. The CLI provides command line access to zbMATH to quickly obtain the bibtex data.
